# Quarto GitHub Pages Deployment - Troubleshooting Guide

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing `.nojekyll` file
**Problem**: GitHub Pages was treating the site as a Jekyll site, which can cause issues with Quarto-generated files.
**Solution**: Added `.nojekyll` file in the `docs` directory and updated the workflow to ensure it's always created.

### 2. ✅ Conflicting GitHub Actions workflows
**Problem**: You had both Jekyll and Quarto workflows running simultaneously, which could cause deployment conflicts.
**Solution**: Removed `jekyll-gh-pages.yml` and kept only the `quarto-publish.yml` workflow.

### 3. ✅ Updated Python dependencies
**Problem**: The workflow was missing some potentially useful packages.
**Solution**: Added `plotly` to the Python dependencies for better visualization support.

### 4. ✅ Improved workflow robustness
**Problem**: The workflow didn't explicitly create the `.nojekyll` file.
**Solution**: Added a step to ensure `.nojekyll` is always present.

## Verification Steps

1. **Local Testing**: ✅ Quarto renders successfully locally
2. **Site Accessibility**: ✅ Site is accessible at https://phatcvo.github.io/Safe-Optimal-Control/
3. **Workflow Status**: ✅ GitHub Actions workflow should run successfully

## Additional Recommendations

### GitHub Repository Settings
Make sure your GitHub Pages settings are configured correctly:
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" section
3. Ensure "Source" is set to "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")

### Local Development
To work locally with all dependencies:
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install jupyter matplotlib numpy pandas plotly

# Preview locally
quarto preview
```

### Monitoring
- Check GitHub Actions tab for workflow status
- Monitor the "Actions" tab in your repository for any build failures
- Check the workflow badge in your README.md

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Site not updating after push
- Check GitHub Actions workflow status
- Ensure all files are committed and pushed
- Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub Pages cache to update

### Issue: Styling issues
- Clear browser cache
- Check if CSS files are being served correctly
- Verify the site_libs directory is included in docs/

### Issue: Links broken
- Ensure all internal links use relative paths
- Check that file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/quarto-publish.yml` - Enhanced workflow
- `docs/.nojekyll` - Added to prevent Jekyll processing
- Removed `.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml` - Conflicting workflow

Your site should now be working at: https://phatcvo.github.io/Safe-Optimal-Control/
