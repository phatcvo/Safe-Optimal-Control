# About This Survey

This website presents a comprehensive survey on **Safe-Optimal Control for Motion Planning based on Reinforcement Learning**. The survey covers the intersection of control theory, safety constraints, and reinforcement learning approaches for autonomous systems.

## Scope

The survey encompasses several key areas:

- **Control Theory Foundations**: Classical optimal control methods, model predictive control, and control-theoretic approaches
- **Safety Considerations**: Robust control, risk-aware planning, and constraint satisfaction in uncertain environments  
- **Learning Approaches**: Reinforcement learning theory and applications, imitation learning, and inverse reinforcement learning
- **Motion Planning**: Search-based, sampling-based, optimization-based, and reactive planning methods
- **Multi-agent Systems**: Game theory and multi-agent reinforcement learning for coordinated control

## Applications

The methods covered in this survey have broad applications including:

- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Self-driving cars, autonomous navigation, and intelligent transportation systems
- **Robotics**: Manipulation, locomotion, and human-robot interaction
- **Aerospace**: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), spacecraft control, and air traffic management  
- **Industrial Systems**: Process control, manufacturing automation, and supply chain optimization
- **Healthcare**: Medical robotics, assistive devices, and automated diagnosis systems
